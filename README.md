This project was made in a couple of days for my to-do app.

It pulls data from the todoist api (https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#overview);

To set up:

*Step 1*
clone the repository

*Step 2*
create a .env file, and add two fields with the same value: 
```APIKEY = '{your api key}' ```
```PUBLIC_APIKEY = '{the same api key}'```

*Step 3*

Run ```bash 
npm run dev
```
